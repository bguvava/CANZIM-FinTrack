### **Key System Requirements**

- **Branding & Logo:** Use official CANZIM logos from `.github/prompts/CANZIM_logo1.png` (primary) and `.github/prompts/CANZIM.png` (alternate). Copy to `/public/images/logo/` directory. Display in: sidebar header, landing page, login page, all PDF reports, email templates, footer
- **User Interface Modals:** ALL system modals, confirmations, alerts, and notifications MUST use SweetAlert2 library. No native browser alerts/confirms. Consistent styling: CANZIM blue theme (#1E40AF), custom icons, smooth animations
- **Smooth Transitions & Animations:** ALL interface elements must have smooth transitions (300ms duration). Page transitions fade-in (200ms), modal slide-in (250ms), button hover effects (150ms), form field focus animations, loading spinners, skeleton screens for data loading
- **Non-Technical User Friendly:** Simple language, clear labels, helpful tooltips, inline help text, guided workflows, confirmation before destructive actions, undo capabilities where possible, visual feedback for all actions
- **Performance & Speed:** < 2s page load, < 500ms API response, instant UI feedback, optimistic UI updates, debounced search (300ms), throttled scroll events, lazy-loaded images, cached API responses
- **PDF Exports Only:** All reports with standardized layout (header: logo + org name, content, footer: generated by + date/time + confidentiality + copyright)
- **Limited Search Filters:** Maximum 5 filters per search to optimize database queries
- **No Bulk Operations:** Except bulk delete/save for activity logs only
- **Document Actions:** View (opens in new tab) + Download (downloads file)
- **Session Timeout:** Auto-logout after 5 minutes of inactivity with SweetAlert2 modal confirmation
- **Developer Credits:** "Developed with ❤️ by bguvava (bguvava.com)" in footer
- **100% Test Pass Rate:** All modules must achieve 100% test coverage with zero failures
- **Incremental Development:** Complete each module 100% before moving to next

### **Dashboard Architecture & SPA Requirements**

- **Centralized Dashboard Shell:** All modules operate within a unified dashboard layout with persistent navigation
- **Persistent Left Sidebar Navigation:** Fixed sidebar with hierarchical menu structure, collapsible with hamburger menu
- **Top Header Bar:** Global search, notification bell with badge counter, user profile dropdown menu
- **Role-Based Menu System:** Dynamic menu items based on user role (Programs Manager, Finance Officer, Project Officer)
- **Breadcrumb Navigation:** Shows current location within application hierarchy
- **Client-Side Rendering:** Vue.js 3 handles all routing and view rendering without full page reloads
- **API-First Architecture:** All data operations via RESTful API endpoints (/api/v1/\*)
- **State Management:** Pinia stores for centralized application state (auth, user, projects, notifications)
- **Single Page Application Flow:** Dashboard is main shell → All modules are child views → No separate standalone pages
- **Consistent UI/UX:** Shared components for navigation, headers, footers across all modules
- **Lazy Loading:** Route-based code splitting for optimal performance
- **Real-Time Updates:** Live data updates for dashboards and notifications
- **Responsive Grid Layout:** Mobile-first design with breakpoints (sm, md, lg, xl, 2xl)

### **Dashboard UI Components**

- **Info Cards/KPI Widgets:** Display key metrics with icons, values, percentage changes, and trend indicators
- **Interactive Charts:** Line charts (trends), bar charts (comparisons), donut/pie charts (distributions)
- **Color-Coded Elements:** Consistent color scheme (Blue #1E40AF primary, semantic colors for status)
- **Search Functionality:** Global search with keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+K / Cmd+K)
- **Notification System:** Bell icon with real-time badge counter, dropdown notification list
- **User Profile Menu:** Avatar dropdown with: Settings, Profile, My Messages, Lock Screen, Logout
- **Active State Indication:** Highlighted current page in sidebar navigation
- **Card-Based Layout:** Elevated cards with shadows for visual hierarchy
- **Progress Indicators:** Loading skeletons, spinners for async operations
- **SweetAlert2 Modals:** ALL system modals use SweetAlert2 - confirmations (delete, logout, submit), alerts (success, error, warning, info), input dialogs (quick forms), toast notifications (bottom-right position, 3s auto-close)
- **Smooth Animations:** Fade-in page transitions (200ms), slide-in modals (250ms), hover effects (150ms), ripple effects on buttons, smooth scrolling, loading animations, skeleton screens

### **Logout Process Workflow**

1. **User Initiates:** User clicks "Logout" button in profile dropdown
2. **Confirmation Modal:** SweetAlert2 modal appears with title "Confirm Logout", message "Are you sure you want to logout?", buttons [Cancel] [Logout]
3. **User Confirms:**
    - API call to /api/v1/logout endpoint
    - Backend invalidates Sanctum token, logs audit trail, clears session
    - Frontend clears Pinia stores, removes token from localStorage, resets state
    - Redirect to landing/login page with success notification
4. **User Cancels:** Modal closes, user remains logged in, no further action
5. **Auto-Timeout (5 min inactivity):**
    - Warning modal appears: "Your session will expire in 60 seconds"
    - User can click "Stay Logged In" to reset timer
    - No action → Force logout → Notification: "Logged out due to inactivity" → Redirect to login

### **Branding & Logo Requirements**

- **Logo Files:** Use `.github/prompts/CANZIM_logo1.png` (primary full-color logo) and `.github/prompts/CANZIM.png` (alternate/white version)
- **Logo Locations:** Copy to `/public/images/logo/canzim_logo.png` and `/public/images/logo/canzim_white.png`
- **Logo Usage:**
    - **Sidebar Header:** Primary logo (150x50px max) at top of collapsed/expanded sidebar
    - **Landing Page:** Large primary logo (250x80px) in hero section
    - **Login Page:** Primary logo (200x65px) above login form
    - **Email Templates:** Primary logo (180x60px) in email header
    - **PDF Reports:** Primary logo (150x50px) in report header (top-left)
    - **Footer:** Small primary logo (100x35px) next to developer credits
    - **Favicon:** Generate 32x32px and 16x16px favicons from logo
    - **Loading Screen:** Animated logo (180x60px) with pulse effect while app initializes

### **SweetAlert2 Modal Standards**

- **Library:** SweetAlert2 v11+ (install via NPM: `npm install sweetalert2`)
- **Global Configuration:** Create `/resources/js/plugins/sweetalert.js` with CANZIM theme settings
- **Theme Customization:**
    - Confirm button: Blue #1E40AF background, white text, hover #1E3A8A
    - Cancel button: Gray #6B7280 background, white text, hover #4B5563
    - Icon colors: Success #10B981, Error #EF4444, Warning #F59E0B, Info #3B82F6
    - Border radius: 12px for modern look
    - Font family: Inherit from TailwindCSS (Inter/System fonts)
    - Animation: Smooth slide-down entrance (250ms), fade-out exit (200ms)

- **Modal Types & Usage:**
    1. **Confirmation Modals:** All destructive actions (delete, archive, cancel) require SweetAlert2 confirmation
        - Example: "Are you sure you want to delete this expense?" [Cancel] [Delete]
    2. **Success Notifications:** Show after successful operations (saved, submitted, approved)
        - Example: "Expense submitted successfully!" with checkmark icon, 2s auto-close
    3. **Error Alerts:** Display validation errors or operation failures
        - Example: "Failed to submit expense. Please check all required fields." [OK]
    4. **Warning Alerts:** Caution user about important information
        - Example: "This budget allocation will exceed your donor funding limit." [Cancel] [Proceed Anyway]
    5. **Info Modals:** Provide helpful information or guidance
        - Example: "Expenses over $1,000 require Finance Officer approval." [Got it]
    6. **Input Dialogs:** Quick data entry without full form page
        - Example: "Enter rejection reason:" [textarea] [Cancel] [Submit]
    7. **Toast Notifications:** Non-intrusive feedback for minor actions
        - Position: bottom-right, 3s auto-close, show icon, stack multiple toasts

- **Consistency Rule:** NEVER use native `alert()`, `confirm()`, or `prompt()`. Always use SweetAlert2.

### **Animation & Transition Standards**

- **Page Transitions:**
    - Route change: Fade-in new page content (200ms ease-in-out)
    - Exit animation: Fade-out old content (150ms) before new content loads
    - Loading state: Skeleton screens during data fetch (no blank white screens)

- **Modal Animations:**
    - SweetAlert2 entrance: Slide-down + fade-in (250ms ease-out)
    - SweetAlert2 exit: Fade-out + slide-up (200ms ease-in)
    - Backdrop: Fade-in dark overlay (200ms) with blur effect

- **Button Interactions:**
    - Hover: Scale 1.02x + slight shadow increase (150ms ease-out)
    - Active/Click: Scale 0.98x (100ms) then return (100ms)
    - Disabled: Opacity 0.5 + cursor not-allowed (no animation)
    - Loading state: Spinner inside button, text "Processing...", disabled

- **Form Field Animations:**
    - Focus: Border color transition blue (200ms), label slide-up if floating
    - Error state: Red border + shake animation (400ms), error message fade-in (150ms)
    - Success state: Green border + checkmark icon fade-in (200ms)
    - Input typing: Debounced validation (300ms after user stops typing)

- **Card Animations:**
    - Hover: Lift effect (translate-y: -4px) + shadow increase (200ms ease-out)
    - Click: Ripple effect from click point (500ms fade-out)
    - Data loading: Skeleton screen (gray pulsing animation) → fade to real content (300ms)

- **List/Table Animations:**
    - New item added: Slide-in from top + highlight background (300ms) → fade highlight (1s)
    - Item removed: Slide-out + fade-out (250ms) → collapse height (200ms)
    - Sorting: Smooth reordering with position transitions (400ms ease-in-out)
    - Pagination: Fade-out old data (150ms) → fade-in new data (200ms)

- **Chart Animations:**
    - Initial render: Animate from zero to value (800ms ease-out) with stagger (50ms delay per bar/point)
    - Data update: Smooth transition to new values (600ms ease-in-out)
    - Hover: Highlight data point + show tooltip with fade-in (150ms)

    - Toast exit: Slide-out to right + fade-out (250ms ease-in)
    - Badge counter: Scale bounce effect when count increases (300ms)

- **Performance Guidelines:**
    - Use CSS transitions/transforms (GPU-accelerated) not JavaScript animations
    - Prefer `transform` and `opacity` for best performance
    - Use `will-change` sparingly for complex animations
    - Debounce rapid events (scroll, resize, typing) to prevent janky animations
    - Respect user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting (disable decorative animations)

### **User Experience for Non-Technical Users**

- **Simple Language:** Avoid technical jargon, use clear everyday language
    - ❌ "API request failed" → ✅ "Unable to connect. Please check your internet connection."
    - ❌ "Validation error" → ✅ "Please fill in all required fields marked with \*"

- **Visual Feedback:** Every action must have immediate visual response
    - Button click: Ripple effect + loading state if async operation
    - Form submission: Disable form + show spinner + "Saving..." message
    - File upload: Progress bar with percentage + "Uploading..." message
    - Success: Green checkmark + success message + auto-close/redirect

- **Helpful Tooltips:** Add tooltips to icons, abbreviations, and complex fields
    - Hover over (?) icon shows explanation in tooltip (e.g., "YTD = Year To Date")
    - Form field help text below input (e.g., "Enter amount in USD without commas")

- **Guided Workflows:** Multi-step processes use step indicators
    - Progress bar showing: Step 1 of 4 → Step 2 of 4 → etc.
    - "Back" and "Next" buttons clearly visible
    - Save draft option for lengthy forms

- **Error Prevention:**
    - Required fields marked with \* (red asterisk)
    - Inline validation as user types (with 300ms debounce)
    - Disable submit button until form is valid
    - Clear error messages next to problematic fields

- **Confirmation Before Destructive Actions:**
    - Delete: SweetAlert2 "Are you sure?" with warning icon
    - Cancel: "You have unsaved changes. Discard changes?" [Go Back] [Discard]
    - Logout: "Are you sure you want to logout?" [Cancel] [Logout]

- **Undo Capabilities:** Where possible, allow undo for recent actions
    - Toast notification: "Expense deleted" [Undo] button (5s timeout)
    - Soft delete: Items moved to trash/archived, can be restored

- **Loading States:** Never show blank screens, always show loading indicators
    - Skeleton screens for content (gray pulsing boxes matching final layout)
    - Spinners for buttons and small operations
    - Progress bars for file uploads and long operations
    - Text: "Loading your dashboard..." / "Processing payment..."

- **Empty States:** Helpful messages when no data exists
    - "No expenses yet. Click 'Add Expense' to get started."
    - "No search results found. Try different keywords."
    - Include helpful illustration/icon and clear call-to-action button

- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** For power users, but don't require them
    - Ctrl/Cmd+K: Global search
    - Ctrl/Cmd+S: Save form
    - Escape: Close modal
    - Show keyboard shortcuts in help menu

- **Mobile-Optimized:** Large touch targets (min 44x44px), easy thumb navigation
    - Bottom navigation bar on mobile for primary actions
    - Swipe gestures for common actions (swipe to delete, pull to refresh)
    - Responsive form layouts (single column on mobile)

## 🔄 **MODULE COMPLETION PROCESS** (CRITICAL - APPLY TO ALL MODULES)

### **Mandatory Workflow for Every Module**

Each module MUST follow this systematic process to ensure 100% completion and quality:

#### **1. Task Breakdown & Sequencing**

- ✅ Break down module into small, manageable tasks (to avoid chat length limits)
- ✅ Execute tasks sequentially, one at a time
- ✅ Complete each task 100% before moving to next
- ✅ Verify task completion with immediate testing
- ✅ Never skip tasks or implement partial solutions

#### **2. Development & Implementation**

- ✅ Build backend first: Migrations → Models → Controllers → Services → API Routes
- ✅ Build frontend next: Components → Pages → Forms → API Integration
- ✅ Implement features according to requirements table (REQ-XXX)
- ✅ Follow coding standards from `.github/prompts/coding_style.json`
- ✅ Use SweetAlert2 for all modals, confirmations, alerts
- ✅ Add smooth animations to all UI elements (transitions, hover effects)
- ✅ Display CANZIM logo from `/public/images/logo/canzim_logo.png` where applicable

#### **3. Testing (100% Pass Rate Required)**

- ✅ Write feature tests for all API endpoints
- ✅ Write unit tests for all services and business logic
- ✅ Write component tests for all Vue components
- ✅ Run tests after each implementation: `php artisan test --filter=ModuleName`
- ✅ Achieve 100% test pass rate (NOT 98%, NOT 99%, MUST be 100%)
- ✅ Fix all failing tests immediately before moving forward
- ✅ Verify zero regressions (old tests still passing)
- ✅ Save all tests in `/tests/module_name/` directory

#### **4. Documentation (Mandatory)**

- ✅ Create module documentation folder: `/docs/module_name/`
- ✅ Document module overview: `/docs/module_name/README.md`
- ✅ Document API endpoints: `/docs/module_name/api-endpoints.md`
- ✅ Document components: `/docs/module_name/components.md`
- ✅ Document database schema: `/docs/module_name/database-schema.md`
- ✅ Document user workflows: `/docs/module_name/user-workflows.md`
- ✅ Include code examples, request/response samples, screenshots (if applicable)

#### **5. Navigation Menu Updates (Critical)**

- ✅ Update sidebar navigation menu in `DashboardLayout.vue` component
- ✅ Add new menu items for this module with appropriate icons (FontAwesome)
- ✅ Configure role-based menu visibility:
    - **Programs Manager**: Full access to all menu items
    - **Finance Officer**: Access to financial modules only (Dashboard, Expenses, Cash Flow, POs, Donors, Reports, Settings)
    - **Project Officer**: Access to project modules only (Dashboard, My Projects, My Expenses, Documents, Comments)
- ✅ Update menu item badge counters if applicable (e.g., pending expenses count)
- ✅ Add active state highlighting for current module
- ✅ Test navigation works for all three user roles

#### **6. Quality Assurance Checklist**

Before marking module as complete, verify:

- ✅ All requirements (REQ-XXX) implemented 100%
- ✅ All API endpoints working and returning correct responses

- ✅ Navigation menu updated for all roles
- ✅ No console errors or warnings
- ✅ No PHP errors in Laravel logs
- ✅ Module performs within requirements (< 2s load, < 500ms API)

#### **7. Git Commit Strategy**

- ✅ Commit after completing each task (not entire module at once)
- ✅ Use conventional commit format: `feat(module): description (REQ-XXX)`
- ✅ Examples:
    - `feat(expenses): create expense submission form (REQ-310)`
    - `test(expenses): add expense submission tests (REQ-310)`
    - `docs(expenses): add API documentation (REQ-310)`
- ✅ Push to GitHub after each significant milestone

#### **8. Module Sign-Off Criteria**

A module is considered 100% complete ONLY when:

1. ✅ All requirements in requirements table implemented
2. ✅ All tests passing at 100% (zero failures)
3. ✅ All documentation complete in `/docs/module_name/`
4. ✅ Navigation menu updated and tested for all roles
5. ✅ Module success criteria (listed at top of module) all met
6. ✅ Code committed to Git with proper commit messages
7. ✅ Module reviewed and verified working end-to-end

#### **9. Task Size Management (Avoid Chat Length Limits)**

To prevent hitting chat length limits:

- ✅ Implement maximum 5-7 requirements per conversation turn
- ✅ For large modules (20+ requirements), break into phases:
    - **Phase 1**: Backend (migrations, models, controllers, API)
    - **Phase 2**: Frontend (components, forms, pages)
    - **Phase 3**: Testing & Documentation
    - **Phase 4**: Navigation menu + final verification
- ✅ Request user confirmation before proceeding to next phase
- ✅ Save progress frequently with Git commits

#### **10. No Shortcuts Policy**

- ❌ NEVER skip tests "to save time"
- ❌ NEVER skip documentation "it's obvious"
- ❌ NEVER implement 80% and call it done
- ❌ NEVER leave TODOs or placeholders
- ❌ NEVER say "the rest is similar" without implementing
- ❌ NEVER merge code with failing tests
- ✅ ALWAYS implement 100% complete, production-ready code
- ✅ ALWAYS achieve 100% test pass rate
- ✅ ALWAYS complete all documentation
- ✅ ALWAYS update navigation menu

## 🎨 **SYSTEM-WIDE DESIGN & UX STANDARDS**

### **Critical Implementation Notes**

⚠️ **ALL modules and features throughout this entire system MUST adhere to the following standards:**

#### 1. **Logo & Branding (100% Compliance Required)**

- ✅ Use ONLY official logo files: `/public/images/logo/canzim_logo.png` (primary) and `/public/images/logo/canzim_white.png` (alternate)
- ✅ Display logo in: Sidebar header (150x50px), Landing page (250x80px), Login page (200x65px), PDF reports header (150x50px), Email templates (180x60px), Footer (100x35px)
- ✅ Favicon generated from logo: favicon.ico, favicon-32x32.png, favicon-16x16.png in `/public/`
- ✅ Logo must have subtle animation on page load (fade-in + scale, 500ms ease-out)
- ✅ Consistent CANZIM blue color scheme: Primary #1E40AF, Secondary #2563EB, Accent #60A5FA, Dark #1E3A8A

#### 2. **SweetAlert2 Modals (Mandatory - No Exceptions)**

- ✅ NEVER use native browser `alert()`, `confirm()`, or `prompt()` - ALWAYS use SweetAlert2
- ✅ ALL confirmations (delete, logout, submit, cancel) use SweetAlert2 confirmation modal
- ✅ ALL success messages use SweetAlert2 success modal with green checkmark icon (2-3s auto-close)
- ✅ ALL error messages use SweetAlert2 error modal with red X icon, user must click "OK"
- ✅ ALL warnings use SweetAlert2 warning modal with yellow exclamation icon
- ✅ ALL info messages use SweetAlert2 info modal with blue "i" icon
- ✅ Toast notifications for non-critical feedback (bottom-right, 3s auto-close, stacking enabled)
- ✅ Consistent button styling: Confirm button blue #1E40AF, Cancel button gray #6B7280
- ✅ 12px border radius, 250ms slide-down animation, backdrop blur effect

#### 3. **Smooth Transitions & Animations (All UI Elements)**

- ✅ Page transitions: Fade-in (200ms ease-in-out) when navigating between routes
- ✅ Modal animations: Slide-down + fade-in (250ms ease-out) on open, fade-out + slide-up (200ms ease-in) on close
- ✅ Button hover: Scale 1.02x + shadow increase (150ms ease-out)
- ✅ Button click: Scale 0.98x (100ms) then return (100ms), ripple effect from click point
- ✅ Form field focus: Border color transition to blue (200ms), label slide-up if floating
- ✅ Form field error: Red border + shake animation (400ms), error message fade-in (150ms)
- ✅ Card hover: Lift effect (translate-y: -4px) + shadow increase (200ms ease-out)
- ✅ List item add: Slide-in from top + highlight background (300ms) → fade highlight (1s)
- ✅ List item remove: Slide-out + fade-out (250ms) → collapse height (200ms)
- ✅ Chart animations: Animate from zero to value (800ms ease-out) with stagger (50ms delay per element)
- ✅ Loading states: Skeleton screens (gray pulsing) → fade to real content (300ms)
- ✅ Toast notifications: Slide-in from right (300ms), slide-out to right (250ms)
- ✅ Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` setting - disable decorative animations for users who need it

#### 4. **User-Friendly Interface (Non-Technical Users)**

- ✅ Simple language: No technical jargon, clear everyday language
- ✅ Visual feedback: Every button click, form submission, data save shows immediate feedback
- ✅ Helpful tooltips: Add (?) icons with explanations for complex fields
- ✅ Inline help text: Below form fields explaining what to enter
- ✅ Required fields: Mark with red asterisk (\*), show clearly
- ✅ Inline validation: Real-time feedback as user types (debounced 300ms)
- ✅ Error prevention: Disable submit until form valid, confirm before destructive actions
- ✅ Clear error messages: "Please enter a valid email address" not "Validation failed"
- ✅ Loading indicators: Never blank screens - always skeleton, spinner, or progress bar
- ✅ Empty states: Helpful messages with call-to-action when no data exists
- ✅ Undo capability: Allow undo for deletions (soft delete with restore option)
- ✅ Success feedback: Green checkmark + success message + optional auto-redirect
- ✅ Large touch targets: Minimum 44x44px for mobile buttons/links

#### 5. **Performance Standards (Speed & Responsiveness)**

- ✅ Page load: < 2 seconds from click to visible content
- ✅ API response: < 500ms for all endpoints
- ✅ Instant UI feedback: Optimistic UI updates (update UI immediately, sync with server in background)
- ✅ Debounced search: 300ms delay after user stops typing before searching
- ✅ Lazy loading: Images, components, routes loaded only when needed
- ✅ Code splitting: Separate bundles per route for optimal initial load
- ✅ Cached responses: Cache frequently accessed API data (5-minute TTL)
- ✅ Smooth scrolling: 60fps animations, no janky transitions

#### 6. **Consistency Across All Modules**

- ✅ Same navigation structure in all modules (persistent sidebar + header)
- ✅ Same button styles: Primary (blue), Secondary (gray), Danger (red), Success (green)
- ✅ Same form layouts: Labels above inputs, consistent spacing, aligned buttons
